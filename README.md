# Multivariate abundance model

This model aims to estimate interactions between communities as well as the influences of known variables including environmental disturbances, sampling design, biological factors, etc.

This repository contains the codes associated to the paper "Coral reef benthic community composition around the world: partitioning the influences of global disturbances from co-occurrence patterns". In this study, we estimated the influences of global disturbances on 16 benthic groups across five biogegraphical regions.
